	<h3 class="neon-text-cyan">The beginnings of NeonPulse</h3>
	<p>It all began in 2018, when SynthKid, a developer passionate about electronics and retro video games, decided to give a second life to the arcade games that marked his childhood. After years of collecting and restoring original arcade cabinets, he had the idea to create an online platform that would allow everyone to enjoy these legendary games.</p>
	<p>At first, NeonPulse was just a small personal project hosted on a home server. But very quickly, the retrogaming community discovered this gem and word of mouth did its work. In just a few months, the site became an essential meeting point for 80s nostalgia enthusiasts and newcomers curious to discover the golden age of arcade halls.</p>
